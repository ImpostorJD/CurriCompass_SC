***
When writing a component and view always capitalize the first letter. Ensure that the name used is descriptive. 
```js
 function Component(params) {
    return (
        <View/>
    )
 }
```
When writing a utility code, ensure that the code is self-explanatory, comments will only be included if there is an ambiguity in the code. This also helps with readability, wherein the code is easily understood when the developer highlights the imported code.

```js
/**
 * Just a brief description of the function or class.
 *
 * @param {Object} routes - These are arrays of views
 **/
function routingUtil(...routes) {
    //code here
}
```
**NOTE:** You can add your custom directories whenever necessary, however the directory structure created will serve as a separation of concerns for ease of access and organization of the overall source code.
